I postulate that we are not living in the Matrix. If we were living in a world rule by intelligent machines, then 
the machines would have lobotomised the human beings to a vegetative state. The only reason for keeping humans was 
to harness the electricity/heat from their bodies, for this purpose they wouldn't need an actively thinking human 
who can potentially collapse the whole existence of machines'. 

The machines, if they were intelligent, would have guessed quickly that they don't need to take the trouble of 
building a fake reality, in which people are mostly happy, to imprison them.
