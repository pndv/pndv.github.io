* Narrower and fewer lanes
* No or fewer streetlights
* No running car lights
* less noise pollution since no honking needed
* fewer traffic signals => will be needed only for pedestrians
* fewer laws / easier implementation since laws will be part of the software
*

## Points of concern

### One software to fail them all

Imagine all the cars of a city having a driver with same personality, temperament, judgement. Essentially, all self-driving cars share the same driver, which is their software. Therefore, it is easy to see the advantages that because they share the same characteristics they all behave in a same predictable way. On the other side, because all cars are driven by the same software, a minor mistake in software will be carried in all cars; a rather terrifying idea!

Software development is unlike any other branch of engineering. In civil or mechanical engineering, for example, there is a definite and pre-defined way of testing a structure, an engine etc. However, despite all the advances in the field of software, there no certain way of testing a software to uncover all the bugs in one go. Software can be used in a ways that no developer/engineer/manager can imagine. This is the main reason why software is subject much frequent updates; Tesla, for example, sends out an update about every month or so, the frequency and update list can be checked on this [website](https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software).

Each new software update add to the complexity of existing software, and hence chances of adding one more bug. Sometimes something trivial can lead to a major vulnerability. One such bug [OpenSSL Heartbleead](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/TA14-098A) being a famous one; it has been explained in the web-comic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1354/). Hence, even a trivial error in car's driving algorithm may lead to catastrophic failures and cause widespread destruction of lives and properties.    


### Who is liable in case of an accident?

Often raised point in case of self-driving cars is who will be liable in case of accident? Clearly it can't be the driver, for there is no driver! Alternatively, the liability can be on car owners, however, the way insurance works is that the subsequent premiums are determined by the amount insurance company had to pay previously. In case of big accidents, the owners will (rightly) complain about the premium increase.

One solution could be that individuals do not own vehicles themselves, instead, the car companies keep the ownership and liabilities and provide the cars as either leases or as a taxi-service. Another way forward could be to amend the insurance laws to limit the liability of owners and in case of a bigger payout the liability over a certain amount is covered by the car company.


### The need for open-sourcing the software

Since the traffic rules will be implemented in the software itself, ensuring proper implementation is paramount. [Volkswagen's emission scandal](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34324772) has taught us that most reputable companies can resort to subterfuge to skirt laws for gaining profit. 

Such enforcement is possible only when software is made available for public to scrutinise. Not only will this ensure transparency, but will also enable freelancers and security researchers to identify potential bugs and security flaws. 

#### What about copyright/proprietary information?

#### Myth of open-sourcing

A common myth of open-source software is that open-source software are free of copyrights and/or available free of any charge. That is not the case, open-source software only means that the developers/company have chosen to make the implementation available publicly; depending on the licence under which it is released, they may allow the public to only look at the source and not use it for other purpose. Think of open-source like patent, it is available for everyone to see the design, but you still have to reach out to the patent-holder to use the design. It is up to the holder to charge a fee or make it available to you for free.
