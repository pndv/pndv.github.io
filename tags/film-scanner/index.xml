&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I recently bought a used Nikon Coolscan 8000 film scanner on eBay. These scanners are old, so much so that Nikon
does not even manufacture them anymore. They were deprecated in early 2000s in favour of Coolscan 9000, and even
9000s are not manufactured anymore! However, 8000 is much cheaper than 9000; while used 9000 go for around
US$3000-5000, whereas used 8000 go for around US$1000-1500.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that these scanners are more than 2 decades old, they still have a cult following (check
the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1514948298527146">Facebook group&lt;/a>).
The reason has to do with the excellent lens, true 4000dpi scanning resolution, 14 bit A/D (analog-to-digital)
converter and, its autofocus mechanism.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Short version, I received a broken piece. Upon turning it on, I could hear some motor noises but the LED power light
did not turn on. Before initiating a return, as eBay allows return of non-working merchandise even if seller stated
that they do not accept return, I decided to open the cover to check if there is anything I can fix quickly.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Simplest of the fix; it fell out of its socket during the shipping. This was the reason I thought the rest of the
repair will be as easy, that maybe some components got misaligned during shipping. This encouraged me to look at the
other issue. Maybe it was just improper handling that some parts were out of alignment.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I saw that the shaft and motor were not touching when I powered on the scanner. I thought that this was another
simple fix, and down the rabbit hole I went&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is what I mean:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>The upper portion (circled) is the shaft-collar that was broken, and I had to get it 3D printed. The lower portion
(circled) is the part I thought was misaligned. When I replaced the shaft-collar, I tried to align the two pieces
together; however, the shaft would slip even with the slightest rotation. Thanks to the amazing community on Facebook;
I found out that even the coupling is broken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I had replaced these parts, the scanner started working normally. But, as soon as I put the cover back on, the
same problem showed up. I removed the cover to see maybe I had incorrectly put some component, or forgot to tighten
a screw. However, as soon as I removed the cover&amp;hellip; scanner started working again. I was left scratching my head,
Turns out, the cover was skewing the whole body to a side. More details in &lt;a href="#spacers">this section&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I went through a few links given on the Facebook group, and many people had used a single-form coupling. However,
that required that the shafts to be ground in order to fit one straight-edge of the coupling. I did not like the
idea because I was worried that I may grind down too much, and also, I may have to return the scanner. So I used
clamp-style jaw, zero-backlash, vibration-damping motor coupling made of aluminium by
&lt;a href="https://www.ruland.com/">Ruland&lt;/a>. These coupling come in three pieces, one hub for the motor shaft, one hub for worm
drive shaft, and a coupling spider and are made in the USA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are, however, expensive (around $50) compared to a coupling like uxCell 5mm to 6mm rigid coupling on
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/a13052700ux0251-Stepper-Coupling-Coupler-Encoder/dp/B00DCAIRIC">Amazon&lt;/a> which is
available for around $10.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/9845T51-9845T416/">motor shaft&lt;/a> is 6mm diameter, 21.8mm long, 15mm outer diameter
(Ruland part MJC15-6-A)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/9845T51-9845T415/">worm drive shaft&lt;/a> is 5mm in diameter, 21.8mm long, 15mm outer
diameter (Ruland part MJC15-5-A)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/9845T485/">coupling spider&lt;/a> fits in the hubs of these coupling (Ruland part JD10/15-98R)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I am a big fan of McMaster-Carr because of the quality components; Amazon is full of third-party sellers who are
either a hit or miss. While you can return the order for a full refund, it&amp;rsquo;s a hassle to order from another seller if
you didn&amp;rsquo;t receive what you ordered, or if the product fails.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The last issue that remained unresolved was that the scanner stopped detecting tray as soon as I put the cover back
on! From the Facebook group, I found a comprehensive repair manual for CoolScan 9000, which is one step up from 8000,
however, overall hardware is the same. That document mentioned that there has to be a 1mm gap between backplate and
the cover. I could not find any such information about 8000 but the spacers are relatively cheap, so I put 2mm
spacers on the backplate, and this fixed the problem!

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The digital cameras have taken over everything. As a hobbyist though, I dislike the idea of taking 100 photos of a
scene with the intention of choosing the good photos later. The &amp;ldquo;later&amp;rdquo; part never comes, and I am stuck with
hundreds of photos where I can&amp;rsquo;t decide which ones to keep and which ones to delete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since photography is a hobby for me, I like to a take leisurely approach and deliberate about each photo before
pressing the button. That, however, does not work when I am shooting digital; I feel compelled to keep taking
pictures lest I may miss a great shot. Film cameras, force me to slow down. There is no 4 frames/second of shoot
mode, no auto-bracketing, and not even a built-in light meter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of it, the quality of photos is hard to beat. I use medium-format film camera and the potential resolution of
these 120mm films is no match for run-of-the-mill digital cameras. You have to shell out a minimum of US$10,000 to
get similar digital camera; and they are bulky to carry around.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>All in all, I am satisfied with the scanner, but not satisfied with the purchase. I wanted a working scanner, but it
turned out to be a project in itself to get it to working condition. I learnt about 3D printing and CAD design, that
is a blessing in disguise. However, I had paid extra money to get a working scanner, and it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to receive
a non-working scanner when it was advertised as working. In fairness, the seller has agreed to reimburse the cost
and a little extra for the trouble. I have sent him all the things I had to purchase to fix the scanner, and I am
yet to hear back on my message. I will keep my fingers crossed and in the meantime, next project is to calibrate the
scanner with a standard IT8 colour profile.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
