all schematics, bill-of-material, source code, CAD designs for the deprecated products; i.e. the products which are
no longer sold, repaired, and for even the replacement parts are no longer manufactured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not only good for environment, but also enables the general public to keep using the products they own for
as long as they wish. This is in line with the copyright and patent laws, wherein the patents and copyrights expire
after a certain time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
