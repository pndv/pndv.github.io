If we were living in a world rule by intelligent machines, then
the machines would have lobotomised the human beings to a vegetative state. The only reason for keeping humans was
to harness the electricity/heat from their bodies, for this purpose they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need an actively thinking human
who can potentially collapse the whole existence of machines'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The machines, if they were intelligent, would have guessed quickly that they don&amp;rsquo;t need to take the trouble of
building a fake reality, in which people are mostly happy, to imprison them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
