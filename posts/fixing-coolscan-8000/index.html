the <a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/1514948298527146>Facebook group</a>).
The reason has to do with the excellent lens, true 4000dpi scanning resolution, 14 bit A/D (analog-to-digital)
converter and, its autofocus mechanism.</p><hr><h2 id=the-trouble>The Trouble

Upon turning it on, I could hear some motor noises but the LED power light
did not turn on. Before initiating a return, as eBay allows return of non-working merchandise even if seller stated
that they do not accept return, I decided to open the cover to check if there is anything I can fix quickly.</p><h3 id=led>LED

This was the reason I thought the rest of the
repair will be as easy, that maybe some components got misaligned during shipping. This encouraged me to look at the
other issue. Maybe it was just improper handling that some parts were out of alignment.</p><h3 id=scanner-not-detecting-the-film-tray>Scanner not detecting the film tray

simple fix, and down the rabbit hole I went&mldr;</p><p>Here is what I mean:

the shaft contained the broken coupling (not shown) is the part I thought was misaligned. When I replaced the
shaft-collar, I tried to align the two pieces together; however, the shaft would slip even with the slightest rotation.
Thanks to the amazing community on Facebook; I found out that even the coupling is broken.</p><p>After I had replaced these parts, the scanner started working normally. But, as soon as I put the cover back on, the
same problem showed up. I removed the cover to see maybe I had incorrectly put some component, or forgot to tighten
a screw. However, as soon as I removed the cover&mldr; scanner started working again. I was left scratching my head,
Turns out, the cover was skewing the whole body to a side. More details in <a href=#spacers>this section</a></p><hr><h2 id=the-fix-and-part-specifications>The fix and part specifications

However,
that required that the shafts to be ground in order to fit one straight-edge of the coupling. I did not like the
idea because I was worried that I may grind down too much, and also, I may have to return the scanner. So I used
clamp-style jaw, zero-backlash, vibration-damping motor coupling made of aluminium by
<a href=https://www.ruland.com/>Ruland</a>. These coupling come in three pieces, one hub for the motor shaft, one hub for worm
drive shaft, and a coupling spider and are made in the USA.</p><p>These are, however, expensive (around $50) compared to a coupling like uxCell 5mm to 6mm rigid coupling on
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/a13052700ux0251-Stepper-Coupling-Coupler-Encoder/dp/B00DCAIRIC>Amazon</a> which is
available for around $10.</p><ul><li>The <a href=https://www.mcmaster.com/9845T51-9845T416/>motor shaft</a> is 6mm diameter, 21.8mm long, 15mm outer diameter

either a hit or miss. While you can return the order for a full refund, it&rsquo;s a hassle to order from another seller if

on! From the Facebook group, I found a comprehensive repair manual for CoolScan 9000, which is one step up from 8000,
however, overall hardware is the same. That document mentioned that there has to be a 1mm gap between backplate and
the cover. I could not find any such information about 8000 but the spacers are relatively cheap, so I put 2mm
spacers on the backplate, and this fixed the problem!

As a hobbyist though, I dislike the idea of taking 100 photos of a
scene with the intention of choosing the good photos later. The &ldquo;later&rdquo; part never comes, and I am stuck with
hundreds of photos where I can&rsquo;t decide which ones to keep and which ones to delete.</p><p>Since photography is a hobby for me, I like to a take leisurely approach and deliberate about each photo before
pressing the button. That, however, does not work when I am shooting digital; I feel compelled to keep taking
pictures lest I may miss a great shot. Film cameras, force me to slow down. There is no 4 frames/second of shoot
mode, no auto-bracketing, and not even a built-in light meter.</p><p>On top of it, the quality of photos is hard to beat. I use medium-format film camera and the potential resolution of
these 120mm films is no match for run-of-the-mill digital cameras. You have to shell out a minimum of US$10,000 to
get similar digital camera; and they are bulky to carry around.</p><h2 id=finishing-thoughts>Finishing thoughts

I wanted a working scanner, but it
turned out to be a project in itself to get it to working condition. I learnt about 3D printing and CAD design, that
is a blessing in disguise. However, I had paid extra money to get a working scanner, and it&rsquo;s frustrating to receive
a non-working scanner when it was advertised as working. In fairness, the seller has agreed to reimburse the cost
and a little extra for the trouble. I have sent him all the things I had to purchase to fix the scanner, and I am
yet to hear back on my message. I will keep my fingers crossed and in the meantime, next project is to calibrate the
scanner with a standard IT8 colour profile.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published"><a class=u-url href=/posts/fixing-coolscan-8000/><time datetime=2022-07-11>2022-07-11</time></a></div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=https://pndv.github.io/posts/fixing-coolscan-8000/>https://pndv.github.io/posts/fixing-coolscan-8000/</a>
