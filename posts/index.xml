If we were living in a world rule by intelligent machines, then
the machines would have lobotomised the human beings to a vegetative state. The only reason for keeping humans was
to harness the electricity/heat from their bodies, for this purpose they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need an actively thinking human
who can potentially collapse the whole existence of machines'.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The machines, if they were intelligent, would have guessed quickly that they don&amp;rsquo;t need to take the trouble of
building a fake reality, in which people are mostly happy, to imprison them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reducing E Waste</title><link>https://pndv.github.io/posts/reducing-e-waste/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 20:01:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://pndv.github.io/posts/reducing-e-waste/</guid><description>&lt;p>Besides Right-to-Repair, a supplementary and much easier law to enact will be to require companies to make public
all schematics, bill-of-material, source code, CAD designs for the deprecated products; i.e. the products which are
no longer sold, repaired, and for even the replacement parts are no longer manufactured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not only good for environment, but also enables the general public to keep using the products they own for
as long as they wish. This is in line with the copyright and patent laws, wherein the patents and copyrights expire
after a certain time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
